## Jeopardy Car Game

This notebook offers a quick, fun way to hone your Jeopardy skills. Players compete in both "Jeopardy!" and "Double Jeopardy!" questions taken from a specific episode, keeping track of score to determine the victor.

This was a really fun exercise, and helped enhance my `pandas` knowledge.
